Heating up! Heidi Klum has a new man in her life and she’s not afraid to show how happy she is.	
The 44-year-old model was seen locking lips with her new beau, 28-year-old Tom Kaulitz, on Sunday, March 25, in Pasadena, California. 
Klum, dressed in a bright red ensemble, stepped out while filming America’s Got Talent auditions to enjoy an intimate moment with the guitarist. 
The new couple were also spotted embracing and sharing a laugh outside the studio while surrounded by crew members and security.
The duo sparked romance rumors on March 14 when they were seen leaving Lorraine Schwartz’s Eye Bangles launch party at Delilah in West Hollywood. 
Although they were not seen interacting during the event, Daily Mail reports that the pair left the star-studded celebration in the same vehicle.
